# Digital-Circuit-Visualization
A project in java with swing framework which visualizes digital circuit components

DIGITAL CIRCUITS VISUALIZATION SOFTWARE Manual

The Software Mainly Consists of 4 sections.
			
				1.Basic Gates Visualization
				
				2.Logic Minimization

				3.Code Converters

				4.Advanced Logic Circuits

Basic Gates Visualization:- It Consists of Basic Operation of Fundamental Logic Circuits(AND,OR,NOT) and Universal Logic Circuits(NAND,NOR).In this section user have to click on either on Basic gates , Fundamental gates or other gates.If user clicks on one gate a new window will open,there he has to select number of inputs.If he click on number button it will change upto 4 inputs.Then, he has to click on 'Continue'.When he clicks, a new tab with image will open.Inputs are given in a manner that he selects the number of inputs.There we have two buttons , 'Start' and 'Check'.Check button leads to give the entire output for all input combinations.Start button led to open the same window once again.

Code Converters:- This Section consists of different code converters like bcd to excess3, bcd to 7-segment display, binary to gray converter, gray to binary, four bit comparator.In this user have to give input on one portion and the output will be displayed on other side except for four bit magnitude comparator.In Four bit Magnitude comparator user have to operate in the manner of basic gates.


Advanced Logic Circuits:-It Deals with the IC Configurations.First , User have to Select the total number of inputs and outputs.Then he has to connect all 14th pins to Vcc and 7th pin to GND.Then , click on "Add a Connection".There some input pins highlighted with pink colors.User can give any input(as previously selected inputs on side bar) to any pin in IC's.Then the corrosponding output will be showed on corrosponding pin.


How to Run:

1. Home.java is having main class
2. compile it and run it.
